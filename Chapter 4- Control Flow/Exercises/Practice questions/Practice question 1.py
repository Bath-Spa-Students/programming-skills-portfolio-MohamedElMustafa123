#Write a python program with if statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the
#variable z if the variable &? is greater than 100.

#assigning a value to variable &
a = 200
#Initializing variables y and z
y = 0
z = 0
#checks if a is greater than 100
if a > 100:
    z = z + 40
    y = y + 20
